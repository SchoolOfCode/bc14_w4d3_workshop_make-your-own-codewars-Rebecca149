/* 
Your challenge is to write a function that finds the number of days between two inputted dates.

NOTES:
- The order in which the dates are inputted in should not matter
- The output should say: `The number of days between the two dates is (number of days)`
- If either, or both of the inputted dates are not valid, the function should return `The inputted dates should be in the form 'yyyy-mm-dd`
- If a date is entered in a valid form (yyyy-mm-dd), the number of days and the month will be valid (e.g. the 31st of Feburary or the 61st of July would not be inputted)
HINT:
- You might want to use the new Date() function- it is specific to the millisecond but the answer must be in days. How can this be done?

function daysBetween(dateStr1, dateStr2) {
// Start coding here!
}

module.exports = {daysBetween}
